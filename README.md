About ℹ️
bookStore is the final project for the Web Systems Development course at NJIT. The project emulates an e-commerce website, specifically taking the form of a manga store. It showcases functionalities typical of an online retail platform, allowing for the management and display of popular manga titles like Naruto and Dragon Ball. This project was implemented using the Django web framework.

Features ✨
Manga Management: 📖

View a list of all available manga titles.

Add new manga records (e.g., title, author, ISBN, publication year, genre).

Update existing manga details.

Delete manga records from the system.

E-commerce Emulation: 🛒

(Assumed, based on "e-commerce website emulation"): Functionalities like displaying product details, potentially a shopping cart (if implemented), and order processing.

User Interface: 🖥️

A simple, intuitive web interface for interacting with the manga data.

Data Persistence: 💾

Stores manga information persistently using a database.

Technologies Used 🛠️
Python: 🐍 The core programming language.

Django: 🌐 A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: 🎨 For the frontend presentation and interactivity.

Database: 🗄️ Typically SQLite for development, and can be configured for PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other relational databases for production.

Getting Started 🚀
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites ✅
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher.

pip: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

Git: For cloning the repository.

An IDE (Optional but Recommended): VS Code, PyCharm, or similar.

Installation ⬇️
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Alexs2256/bookStore.git
cd bookStore/bookstore

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

Install project dependencies:
With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming a requirements.txt file exists
# If no requirements.txt, you might need:
# pip install Django

Apply database migrations:
Navigate to the inner bookstore directory (where manage.py is located) and run:

python manage.py migrate

This command sets up the necessary database tables.

Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):

python manage.py createsuperuser

Follow the prompts to create an administrator account.

Usage 🎮
Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL.

Default URL (if running locally):

Typically http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should then be able to:

View the list of manga titles.

Interact with the application's features (e.g., add new manga, edit details, delete entries).

Access the Django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (if you created a superuser).
